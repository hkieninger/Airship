Do not use these scripts if you have made or want to make some custom modification to the following configuration files:
-/etc/dhcpcd.conf
-/etc/dnsmasq.conf
-/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
-/etc/default/hostapd

The script might not run on all raspian versions and/or raspberry pi models.
Take care not to delete this folder after having run the script, else the script won't be able to revert the changes.
